//! `UserCommand` — the GoF Command pattern's **Command** role for
//! the entire ttymap crate.
//!
//! `UserCommand` is the **single enum** that anything inside the app
//! can emit to request a state change — palette providers, plugins'
//! key handlers, plugins' async pending output, the mouse adapter,
//! and (one day) external control surfaces like an HTTP/JSON-RPC
//! front. Every invoker speaks the same vocabulary; only the App,
//! as the GoF Receiver, executes.
//!
//! ## Layout choice: top-level module
//!
//! `UserCommand` lives at the crate root rather than inside `app/`
//! even though `App::dispatch` is the only consumer. The producers
//! span every layer (`compositor::base`, `compositor::window`,
//! `input::keymap`, `input::mouse`, `lua::api::map`,
//! `lua::api::imperative`, `palette::provider::*`, …); putting the
//! type next to its single Receiver would force every producer to
//! `use crate::app::UserCommand`, which is an upward dependency at
//! the import-graph level even though the design has nothing
//! upward about it. Keeping the vocabulary type foundational means
//! every producer reaches it via `crate::UserCommand` and no
//! crossing layer has to know that App owns the dispatch loop.
//!
//! ## Pattern roles
//!
//! - **Command** — `UserCommand` (this enum)
//! - **Invoker** — keymap, mouse adapter, palette providers, Lua
//!   callbacks, render-thread completions, …
//! - **Receiver** — [`crate::app::App`] (sole executor; see
//!   [`crate::app::App::dispatch`])
//! - **Client** — `main.rs` (composition root)
//!
//! Surface activation (palette open, plugin activate) intentionally
//! does *not* live here — those are focus transitions, handled
//! internally by the [`crate::compositor::Compositor`] via
//! [`Window::open`](crate::compositor::window::Window::open) /
//! [`Window::close`](crate::compositor::window::Window::close) calls
//! from a [`Component`](crate::compositor::Component). Keeping them
//! off `UserCommand` means the focus state machine isn't coupled to
//! the dispatch table.
