//! [`Window`] — capability-constrained handle passed to components.
//!
//! Components receive a `&mut Window` on every hook (`handle_event`
//! and `poll`). They express intent by calling methods on it:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn handle_event(&mut self, ev: KeyEvent, win: &mut Window) {
//!     if ev.code == KeyCode::Esc {
//!         win.close();
//!     } else if enter_with_selection {
//!         win.emit(AppMsg::Jump(loc));
//!         win.close();
//!     } else if ev.code == KeyCode::Char('/') {
//!         win.close();
//!         win.open(Box::new(SearchComponent::new()));
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Method calls queue into [`WindowOps`]. The compositor drains the
//! queue after the hook returns and applies the ops atomically in a
//! deterministic order: `close` → `opens` (with TypeId dedup) → and
//! the collected `msgs` are returned to `App::dispatch`.
//!
//! # Why a handle instead of a return value
//!
//! Returning an `EventResult` enum with one variant per op
//! combination (`Close`, `Push`, `CloseAndPush`, …) does not scale
//! — every new compound op needs a new variant. The handle queues
//! primitive ops so compounds are expressed by composition. Plugin
//! still cannot hold `&mut Compositor` or mutate the stack directly;
//! the compositor is the sole applier of the queue, so invariants
//! (focus, dedup, clamp) remain framework-enforced.
