// The crate is primarily a binary (see src/main.rs). The library exists so
// tests can share a module tree; external consumers only need the handful
// of items used by main.rs, so everything else is `pub(crate)`.

/// Application event loop and central message dispatcher. Also home
/// of the [`AppMsg`](app::AppMsg) vocabulary — the single enum every
/// emission site (palette, plugins, mouse, future RPC) speaks and that
/// [`App::dispatch`](app::App) interprets.
pub mod app;

/// CLI subcommand implementations. Each subcommand lives in its own
/// submodule; `main.rs` just parses the top-level enum and calls
/// [`commands::Command::run`].
pub mod commands;

/// Helix-style compositor stack — the focus/modal system that
/// replaced the old FocusManager / FocusSurface / Plugin trio. Holds
/// the `Component`, `Painter`, `Task`, `Registrar` abstractions that
/// every plugin plugs into, plus the always-on `BaseLayer`
/// (keymap fallback + activation dispatch).
pub(crate) mod compositor;

/// Settings loaded from `~/.config/ttymap/config.toml` + CLI overrides.
pub mod config;

/// Map subsystem — viewport state, action dispatch, and the full map
/// rendering pipeline (tile fetch, styler, render thread). `MapFrame`
/// produced here is what the UI displays.
pub mod map;

/// Theme — colour palette data (`ColorPalette`, `DARK`, `BRIGHT`) plus
/// the ratatui adapter (`UiTheme`). `ThemeId` drives everything. Lives
/// at the crate root because it's a **plugin-facing service** —
/// plugins read colours from it during `render()`, so putting it under
/// `ui/` would recreate the ui↔plugin cycle we just broke. Marked
/// `pub #[doc(hidden)]` so benches under `benches/` can reach
/// `ThemeId` without treating it as stable API.

/// Plugin API — opt-in toolbox for plugin authors. Counterpart to the
/// plugin *trait* (`compositor::Component`): the trait is the contract
/// the framework calls into, while this module holds the cross-cutting
/// helpers plugins call out to (`PolledFeed`, future label / marker
/// helpers). Subsystem-specific surfaces like `MapApi` live with
/// their owning subsystem instead.
///
/// All in-tree plugins are now Lua (see `src/lua/scripts/`). This
/// module remains because the Lua bridge re-uses some of its
/// primitives — notably `MapApi` and `PanelAnchor`.
pub(crate) mod plugin_api;

/// Command palette — `:`-triggered universal picker. Lives as a peer
/// of `plugin/` (not inside it) because palette has privileged
/// integration with the compositor's `Registrar`: it *drains*
/// `palette_entries` at install time rather than contributing one.
/// Plugins still plug into it via `Registrar::add_palette_entry`.

/// Lua runtime for scripted plugins (mlua, Lua 5.4 vendored).
/// **Scaffold only** — owns the shared [`mlua::Lua`] state and the

/// fetch+render plugins migrate from Rust to Lua.
